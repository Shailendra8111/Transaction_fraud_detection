Task 2:-On the basis of employee performance indexes provided in the features predict the identifying of root causes of these performance issues is essential.

Task 3:- Prepare the analysis report stating how model will help expanding the business by stating several factors including feature importance.

## Domain Analysis
### step

Description: Represents the time step of the transaction, likely in hours or minutes from the start of data collection.
Domain: Integer values starting from 1.
Significance: Helps to sequence transactions and analyze patterns over time.
### type

Description: The type of transaction.
Domain: Categorical values such as 'PAYMENT', 'TRANSFER', 'CASH_OUT', 'DEBIT', 'CASH_IN'.
Significance: Different transaction types might have varying fraud risks; for example, 'TRANSFER' and 'CASH_OUT' are often scrutinized more closely for fraud.
### amount

Description: The amount of money involved in the transaction.
Domain: Continuous numerical values, typically non-negative.
Significance: Large transactions may be more likely to be fraudulent. Patterns in transaction amounts can also be a strong indicator of fraudulent activity.
### nameOrig

Description: The identifier of the origin account.
Domain: Alphanumeric strings.
Significance: Helps in tracking the source of transactions and analyzing account behavior. Patterns of transactions originating from the same account can provide insights into fraud.
### oldbalanceOrg

Description: The initial balance of the origin account before the transaction.
Domain: Continuous numerical values, typically non-negative.
Significance: Understanding the balance before a transaction can help in identifying unusual patterns, such as sudden large transactions from low-balance accounts.
### newbalanceOrig

Description: The balance of the origin account after the transaction.
Domain: Continuous numerical values, typically non-negative.
Significance: Comparing the new balance with the old balance can help verify the legitimacy of transactions. Discrepancies might indicate fraud.
### nameDest

Description: The identifier of the destination account.
Domain: Alphanumeric strings.
Significance: Similar to nameOrig, it helps in tracking where the money is going. Certain destination accounts might be more prone to receiving fraudulent transactions.
### oldbalanceDest

Description: The initial balance of the destination account before the transaction.
Domain: Continuous numerical values, typically non-negative.
Significance: Useful for identifying unusual account behavior, especially when a destination account suddenly receives large sums of money.
### newbalanceDest

Description: The balance of the destination account after the transaction.
Domain: Continuous numerical values, typically non-negative.
Significance: Helps in verifying the transaction amount and identifying discrepancies that could indicate fraud.
### isFraud

Description: Indicator of whether the transaction is fraudulent.
Domain: Binary values (0 or 1), where 1 indicates fraud.
Significance: The target variable for fraud detection models. Identifies which transactions are fraudulent, serving as ground truth for training and evaluation.
### isFlaggedFraud

Description: Indicator of whether the transaction was flagged as fraudulent by the system.
Domain: Binary values (0 or 1), where 1 indicates that the transaction was flagged.
Significance: Helps to evaluate the performance of the fraud detection system. Discrepancies between isFraud and isFlaggedFraud indicate false positives or false negatives.
### Summary
The dataset is structured to facilitate the detection of fraudulent transactions by providing detailed information about each transaction, including temporal data (step), transaction specifics (type, amount), account information (nameOrig, nameDest), and balance changes (oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig, oldbalanceDest, newbalanceDest). The binary indicators (isFraud, isFlaggedFraud) are critical for developing and evaluating fraud detection models.

### Recommendations for Further Analysis
Descriptive Statistics: Compute summary statistics for each numerical column to understand the distribution and identify any anomalies.
Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between variables, especially how transaction types, amounts, and balance changes relate to fraud.
Pattern Detection: Identify patterns or clusters of fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the fraud detection system using isFraud and isFlaggedFraud.
By understanding each column's domain and significance, we can better prepare the data for modeling and improve the detection of fraudulent transactions.
